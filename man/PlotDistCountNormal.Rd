\usage{
PlotDistCountNormal(
  frm,
  xvar,
  title,
  ...,
  binWidth = c(),
  hist_color = "black",
  normal_color = "blue",
  mean_color = "blue",

}
\arguments{
\item{frm}{data frame to get values from}

\item{xvar}{name of the independent (input or model) column in frame}

\item{title}{title to place on plot}

\item{...}{no unnamed argument, added to force named binding of later arguments.}

\item{binWidth}{width of histogram bins}

\item{hist_color}{color of empirical histogram}

\item{normal_color}{color of matching theoretical normal}

\item{mean_color}{color of mean line}

\item{sd_color}{color of 1-standard deviation lines (can be NULL)}
}
\description{
Compares empirical data to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation.
}
\details{
Plots the histograms of the empirical distribution and of the matching normal distribution.
Also plots the mean and plus/minus one standard deviation.

Bin width for the histogram is calculated automatically to yield approximately 50 bins across the
range of the data, unless the \code{binWidth} argument is explicitly passed in. \code{binWidth} is reported
in the subtitle of the plot.

if (requireNamespace('data.table', quietly = TRUE)) {

PlotDistCountNormal(d,'wt','example')

# # no sd lines
# PlotDistCountNormal(d, 'wt', 'example', sd_color=NULL)
