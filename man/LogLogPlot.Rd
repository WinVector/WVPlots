\arguments{
\item{frame}{data frame to get values from}

\item{xvar}{name of the independent (input or model) column in frame}

\item{yvar}{name of the dependent (output or result to be modeled) column in frame}

\item{title}{title to place on plot}

\item{...}{no unnamed argument, added to force named binding of later arguments.}

\item{use_coord_trans}{logical if TRUE, use coord_trans instead of \code{coord_trans(x = "log10", y = "log10")} instead of \code{scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()} (useful when there is not enough range to show ticks).}

\item{point_color}{the color of the data points}

\item{linear_color}{the color of the linear growth lines}

\item{quadratic_color}{the color of the quadratic growth lines}

\item{smoothing_color}{the color of the smoothing line through the data}

\description{
Plot a trend on log-log paper.
}
\details{
This plot is intended for plotting functions that are observed costs
or durations as a function of problem size.  In this case we expect
the ideal or expected cost function to be non-decreasing.
Any negative trends are assumed to arise from the noise model.
The graph is specialized to compare non-decreasing linear and
non-decreasing quadratic growth.

Some care must be taken in drawing conclusions from log-log plots,
as the transform is fairly violent.  Please see:
"(Mar's Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a fat magic marker"
(from Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design \url{https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html}),
and "So You Think You Have a Power Law" \url{http://bactra.org/weblog/491.html}.
